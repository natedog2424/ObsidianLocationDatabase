# Obsidian Location Database Plugin

This project provides a simple button and action to create a new note from an Apple Maps URL with the frontmatter containing the metadata from the URL and a link to a map image through cartes.io

This plugin was created with the Database Folders plugin and the Dataview plugin in mind.

## Features

- Ribbon button
- Command
- Set custom location for new notes
- Auto generated maps image

> ### **A note on cartes.io**
>
> Cartes.io provides a free API for generating the maps images. It is completely free and doesn't require an API key however there are daily rate limits in place so these may cause the plugin to stop working after heavy use*

## Limitations

Currently only works for Apple Maps. Adding Google Maps or another maps platfrom is possible and I welcome and PRs

## Future Plans

I made this plugin for myself to organize my locations of interest so as I use the plugin I may make updates that benefit the plugin and I will share them. Additionally, if anyone wants to make their own contributions that would be awesome!

Here's some features I want to add

- Slippy map view that shows all locations in a folder
- Slippy map view when you open a note with coordinates in the frontmatter
- Find a relevant cover image automatically
- Get business data automatically (phone number, hours, category, etc.)

Apple maps provides free slippy map embeds https://developer.apple.com/maps/web/
